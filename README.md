## VERYTHING ABOUT ME ! 

I'm AEKKAVIT LEIM. I graduated with Science and Food Technology, from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang. 

I tried to enrolled the Food-Sci job as should be in previously years then NO ONE accept me to work with them cause I DIDN'T CLEARIFY ABOUT MILITARY STATUS, 
I'm stressful with that thing, thinking emphasize about my future still as loop but I found the hope from Facebook Page as name "DataRockie" that posted free-course about Data Science/Data Analyst skills after that I learned by watching P'Toy tutorial on his page but I feels/I need it more/I want to be as him came across from another Bachelor to working as Data Analyst

In 2022, I saw Data Science Bootcamp #5 by DataRockie on Facebook feed. I registed this course and taking a lot of experience from this course such as Spreadsheet, SQL, R, Python, Data Dashboard and any skills/domain that mandatory to work as Data Analyst. I hope you will give opportunity and chance to work with you guys.


So,I really want to be as Data Analyst
