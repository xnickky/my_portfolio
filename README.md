######## EVERYTHING ABOUT ME ! ########

I'm AEKKAVIT LEIM. I graduated with Science and Food Technology, from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang. 

I tried to enrolled the Food-Sci job as should be in previously years then NO ONE accept me to work with them cause I DIDN'T CLEARIFY ABOUT MILITARY STATUS, 
I'm stressful with that thing, thinking emphasize about my future stil as a loop but I found the hope from Facebook Page as name "DataRockie" that posted free-course about Data Science/Data Analyst skills after that I learned by watching P'Toy teaching on his page but I feels/I need it more/I want to be as him came across from another Bachelor to working as Data Analyst
In 2022, I saw Data Science Bootcamp #5 by DataRockie. I registed this course and taking a lot of experience from this course such as Spreadsheet, SQL, R, Python, Data Dashboard and any skills that mandatory to work as Data Analyst.
